Desktop GUI available at: valeo@uvic.ca by request. This GUI enables rapid calculation of membership functions and crisp values for specific combinations of land use, soil, and slope, and possesses cross-watershed transferability since its fuzzy rules are based on expert knowledge. The derived local fuzzy entropy can be applied in subsequent watershed algorithms, thereby achieving enhanced visualization and efficient runoff derivation.
