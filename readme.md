Desktop GUI (download via the Releases panel on the right). It enables rapid computation of membership functions and crisp values for specific land-use, soil, and slope combinations, and is transferable across watersheds because its fuzzy rules are expert-derived. The resulting local fuzzy entropy can be integrated into downstream watershed algorithms for enhanced visualization and efficient runoff derivation. For access or questions: valeo@uvic.ca
